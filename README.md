## Hello, my name is Christine. I'm a front-end web developer. 🙋🏾

I am currently learning React, as well as constantly brushing up on my existing skills!
<br/>
In the future I would also like to learn UX and UI design, so that I can both design and build beautiful websites.

## Languages I work with:
